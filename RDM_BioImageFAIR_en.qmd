## Characteristics of shared images{.center}

::: {style="text-align: left;font-size: 60%"}
- [Raw]{style="color:orange;"} and [processed]{style="color:green;"} images (processing operations should not alter the original image).
- [Uncompressed]{style="color:green;"} and [lossless]{style="color:green;"} open file formats.
- OME-TIFF retain original (i.e .czi) metadata.
- PNG (images with annotations) is preferred.
- Accurate and descriptive (machine readable) [naming conventions]{style="color:green;"} (i.e Subject_Group_Area_Marker): Use grouping factors to name images.
- Creation of [README files]{style="color:green;"} to contextualize and describe the content and methods used in the dataset. 
- Use CC-BY, or CC0 licenses.

# Sharing reproducible workflows

In any research workflow, the analysis of images must be:

## Image analysis from RDM perspective {.center}

:::: {style="text-align: left;font-size: 80%"}
From an RDM perspective, analysis of biomedical images ideally entails:

- {{< bi unlock >}} Access to large datasets.
- {{< bi file-earmark-text-fill >}} Records of image processing (code, scripts). 
- {{< bi share-fill >}} Sharing of results (images, tables, graphs). 
:::

:::: {style="text-align: left;font-size: 80%"}
::: callout-tip
Accurate, descriptive [naming conventions and README]{style="color:green;"} files with metadata, or codebooks are vital to assure the integrity of analysis pipelines. 
:::
::::

## Modular approach for image analysis{.center}

A [modular pipeline]{style="color:green;"} establishes the main image analysis tasks into independent sub tasks.

```{mermaid}
%%| fig-width: 20

flowchart LR
A[Nuclei detection] --> B[Quantification] 
B --> C[Spatial analysis]
```

:::: {style="text-align: left;font-size: 80%"}
::: callout-tip
Modularity allows to [construct complex analysis pipelines]{style="color:green;"} from independent components that can function together. This promotes the [reuse]{style="text-decoration: underline;"} of independent modules.

**Low-level (technical knowledge)**

Transform images in other images or data:

- Preprocessing (e.g. deconvolution, noise removal)
- Object detection and segmentation (e.g. cells, intracellular organelles)
- Particle/object tracking

## Why to use code?{.center}

::: {style="text-align: left;font-size: 80%"}
"The mouse is antisocial. The GUI is antisocial. So, what's that mean? You have a problem to solve, and you solve it with a GUI. What do you have? A problem solved. But when you solve it with a command line interface in a scripting environment, you have an [artifact]{style="color:green;"}. And all of the sudden, that artifact can be shared with someone" **Jeffrey Snover**

:::


## Overall{.center}

::: callout-tip
- Keep track of all changes and analysis procedures perform to images. 
- Organize and link files (using naming conventions) through processing to avoid errors.
- Select final or intermediate results to share considering aspects such as storing space and long-term preservation.

## Publication of analysis results{.center}

:::: {style="text-align: left;font-size: 80%"}
Sharing of [research objects]{style="color:green;"} in public, active research management repositories, like the [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/) is an excellent strategy to promote open, reproducible research. Please consider sharing illustrative images, figures and tables used in publication.

## {{< bi share-fill >}} Sharing data is a professional responsibility{.center}

Depositing a dataset in a repository is [NOT ONLY]{style="color:red;"} an exercise in meeting the requirements of funding agencies and journals.
